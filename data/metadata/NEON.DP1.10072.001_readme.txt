Data Product Description
This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's small mammal sampling protocol. Small mammal abundance and diversity are sampled at regular intervals by NEON field technicians at core and relocatable sites. Sampling is based on the lunar calendar, with timing of sampling constrained to occur within 10 days before or after the new moon. Sampling may occur as frequently as every new moon (i.e., 12 or 13 times per year) or as infrequently as 4 times per year (i.e., every other new moon from April - October), depending on logistical constraints (e.g., deep snow, limited labor resources). Typically, core sites are sampled 6 times per year, and relocatable sites 4 times per year. Small mammals are sampled using box traps (models LFA, XLK, H.B. Sherman Traps, Inc., Tallahassee, FL, USA) and, at sites in Puerto Rico and Hawaii, larger wire traps suitable for catching Rattus spp. (model 201, Tomahawk Live Trap, Hazlehurst, WI, USA). Box traps are arrayed in three to eight (depending on the size of the site) 10 x 10 grids with 10m spacing between traps at all sites. Where used, wire traps are used only in alternate bouts of trapping and placed at every other trap station in the 10 x 10 grid, such that a total of 50 wire traps are set. For additional details on protocol, see the TOS Protocol and Procedure: Small Mammal Sampling (http://data.neoninc.org/documents). Products resulting from this sampling include the species identification and unique identifier for each individual captured, as well as a suite of standard size measurements and reproductive condition data.   

The data download contains 3 files:
NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10072.001.mam_perplotnight - Small mammal trapping summary data per plot per night.
NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.10072.001.mam_pertrapnight - Small mammal trapping data per trap per night.

File naming convention for NEON observation systems data files: NEON.DOM.SITE.DPL.PRNUM.REV.DESC, where:
- NEON denotes the organizational origin of the data product and identifies the product as operational; data collected as part of a special data collection exercise are designated by a separate, unique alphanumeric code created by the PI
- DOM is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to the domain of data acquisition (D01 - D20)
- SITE is four-character alphanumeric code, referring to the site of data acquisition; all sites are designated by a standardized four-character alphabetic code
- DPL is a three-character alphanumeric code, referring to data product processing level
- PRNUM is a five-character numeric code, referring to the data product number (see the Data Product Catalog at http://data.neonscience.org/data-product-catalog)
- REV is a three-digit designation, referring to the revision number of the data product; it is also used to track "Data Product Maturity", from Engineering-Grade/Provisional to Science-Grade (001 = initial REV, Engineering-Grade or Provisional; 101 = initial REV, Science-Grade)
- DESC is an abbreviated description of the data product

All of the above data are also directly linked to the rodent-borne pathogen data, as described in the NEON Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document: Rodent-borne Pathogens - QA/QC of Raw Field and Lab Data.

Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been âfuzzedâ, i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published.

These data are considered provisional (created using a baseline algorithm approach with a minimal or reduced set of QA/QC checks). Minor updates to the QA/QC and processing algorithms will occur during construction (prior to 2018). Changes to provisional data products will occur on an as-needed basis. Please check back to this site for updates tracked in change logs. Query reproducibility on provisional data cannot be guaranteed.  

Change log:
8/10/2016 PlotIDs were corrected and added to the data display, fixing issue from 3/25/2016.
3/25/2016 An unknown subset of plotIDs were discovered to be duplicated and/or incorrect in the existing data displayed on the portal.  PlotIDs have been removed from the data download until this issue is rectified.
05/19/2015 Corrected error in taxon table that prevented publication of records for NEFL at JERC; PEGO at JERC, OSBS, and DSNY; and PEPO at JERC and TALL, data processed prior to this date may be affected.
11/20/2014 Corrected pertrapnight duplicate records test
11/20/2014 Corrected calculation of setTraps and disturbedTraps to include only unique values of trapCoordinates to prevent errors arising from duplicate records
11/20/2014 Corrected algorithm to assign reproductiveCondition
11/20/2014 Disabled orderTagIDRecaptureQF algorithm, default value of '-1' assigned to all records, awaiting further development of database and querying infrastructure
11/20/2014 Updated consistencyTagIDTaxonIDQF to run majority rule test where taxonIDs are NOT NULL
11/20/2014 Removed values in pregnancyStatus where sex == âMâ
11/20/2014 All data have been reprocessed incorporating the above changes.
